.SH DESCRIPTION
Simple shell is a fundamental command line user interface where you which provides all basic built-in commands. Allows to execute commands There are two types of commands: builtin commands, and normal programs -- and the command is searched for (by name) in that order. They each are executed in a different way.
Shell builtins are executed internally to the shell, without spawning a new
process.
Otherwise, the command is searched for as a normal program in the file system (as described in the next section). The shell will interpret the program in a subshell.
.SS "Path Search"
When locating a command, the shell first looks for a builtin command by that name. If a builtin command is not found, one of two things happen:
.IP "1."
Command names containing a slash are simply executed without performing any
searches.
.IP "2."
The shell searches each entry in PATH in turn for the command. The value of the PATH variable should be a series of entries separated by colons. Each entry consists of a directory name. The current directory may be indicated implicitly by an empty directory name, or explicitly by a single period.

.SH OPTIONS

.B Built-int commands supported:

.TP
exit [STATUS]
 Exit simple shell.
.br

.TP
help [BUILTIN]
 Display help of builtin command.
.br

.TP
env
 Display environment variables.
.br

.TP
cd [DIRECTORY]
 Change directory.
 If no argument is given to cd the command is interpreted as cd $HOME.

 Updates the environment variable PWD when changing directory.
.br

.TP
setenv VARIABLE VALUE
 Set environment variable value or create a new one.
.br

.TP
unsetenv VARIABLE
 Delete environment variable.
.br

.TP
alias VARIABLE VALUE
 Set an alias variable value or create a new one.
.br

.TP
unalias VARIABLE
 Delete an alias variable.
.br

.TP
history
Display the last commands used, one command by line, preceded with line numbers
(starting at 0). On exit, write the entire history, without line
numbers, to a file named .simple_shell_history in the directory
$HOME. When the shell starts, read the file .simple_shell_history
in the directory $HOME if it exists, and set the first line number to the
total number of lines in the file modulo 4096.
.br

.SH EXIT STATUS
.PP
There are different posible exit status, this deppende on the success of the last command.

.P
0

INTERACTIVE MODE

.TS
tab(;) allbox;

l l
l l
l l.
Commands;Display
$: ls;hsh
$: pwd;/home/vagrant/simple_shell
$: cd && pwd;/home/vagrant/
$: echo Hello; Hello
.TE


NON INTERACTIVE MODE
.TS
tab(;) allbox;
l l
l l
l l
l l.
Commands;Display
$ echo "ls" | ./hsh;hsh
$ echo "pwd" | ./hsh;/home/vagrant/simple_shell
$ echo "cd && pwd" | ./hsh;/home/vagrant/
$ echo "echo Hello" | ./hsh;Hello
.TE


FILE MODE
.br
Create a file (in that exemple the filename will be "my_file"), put one command by line and save it :

ls
.br
pwd
.br
cd && pwd
.br
echo Hello
.br

.TS
tab(;) allbox;
l l
l l.
Commands;Display
$ ./hsh my_file;hsh
;/home/vagrant/simple_shell
;/home/vagrant/
;Hello
.TE


.SH EXIT STATUS
Errors that are detected by the shell, such as a syntax error, will cause the shell to exit with a non-zero exit status.  If the shell is not an interactive shell, the execution of the shell file will be aborted.  Otherwise the shell will return the exit status of the last command executed, or if the exit builtin is used with a numeric argument, it will return the argument.


.SH ENVIRONMENT

.TP
HOME
 Set automatically by login(1) from the user's login directory in the password file (passwd(4)).  This environment variable also functions as the default argument for the cd builtin.
.br

.TP
PATH
 The default search path for executables.  See the above section Path Search.
.br

.TP
MAIL
 The name of a mail file, that will be checked for the arrival of new mail.  Overridden by MAILPATH.
.br

.TP
TERM
 The default terminal setting for the shell.  This is inherited by children of the shell, and is used in the history editing modes.
.br

.TP
PWD
 The logical value of the current working directory.  This is set by the cd command.
.br

.TP
OLDPWD
 The previous logical value of the current working directory.  This is set by the cd command.
.br
